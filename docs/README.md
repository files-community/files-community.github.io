# What is Files?
Files is a file explorer which leverages the latest features of the Windows platform including Fluent Design, seamless updates, and APIs which enable the performance and lifecycle behavior that users expect. Whether you want to simplify your experience with your files or try something new, Files is a one-stop solution to exploring your files on the fly.

# Vision for Files
In the short term, we plan to focus on crucial functionality to achieve parity with Windows File Explorer. Before leaving beta, we'll address many of these pain points and improve accessibility. Later on, the project will reach a point where we can fully celebrate our core audience by adding sought-after power user features. Stay tuned!
